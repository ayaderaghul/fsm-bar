## how to run in mathematica

before running, it's necessary to change the directory for the output.

- open `basic.rkt`, the CONFIGURATION is at the beginning:

- change the directory to smt like: "/Users/linhchi.nguyen/Dropbox/fsm-bar/run1/"
this directory will be append before the file name, it's better to append "" (nothing) so that the output is exported in the current directory

- then change the variables accordingly, for example: N 100, CYCLES 100000...

- then run the file `run-in-matha.nb` in mathematica (in that file, mathematica set directory as the current directory)

in general (and inside mathematica), the command to run is

```
raco test -s rund basic.rkt
```
or 
```
racket -tm side.rkt
```

with -tm and no further specification, racket will evaluate the function `main defined inside the file side.rkt, raco will run the test module inside the file, (this may be necessary when there is not only one main module inside the file, for example, run in continual probability fashion or run in discount factor fashion)

### how to run in lab 1 computer:

- change the directory for the output into a dropbox folder
(ie smt like: "/Users/linhchi.nguyen/Dropbox/fsm-bar/run1/mean.png")

```
(require (file "/Users/linhchi.nguyen/Documents/fsm-bar/main.rkt"))

```

### how to run in disa lab computer:
- change directory for output:
"C:/Documents and Settings/linhchi.nguyen/My Documents/Dropbox/fsm-bar/run6/mean"

```
(require (file "R:/fsm-bar/main.rkt"))
```

## To do

| To do         | Date          | By    | Note |
| ------------- |:-------------:| ----- |:----:|
| spin off from sample-fsm2      | 7 Dec | chi | |
| change "automata.rkt" to fit bargaining game | 7 Dec | ||
| add classic automata | 8 Dec |||
| plot the number of types in each cycle | x | |
| pass test 1 and test 2 of RD | x | ||
| fix out-rank |x|||
| run across delta | 11 dec |||
| write a montecarlo |||hm|
| optimize code, now time is spent in match-up and rank | |||
| write acknowledgement | x |||
| test 3 passed | 28 dec | ||
| output to dropbox |x|||
| draw the new automata to check |x|||
| run in matha | x |||
| restructure code | 30 dec|||
| print simulation settings as title | x |||
| able to run across N, rounds, deltas | x |||
| two different methods of deltas | 9 jan | ||
| set states# = 100 | x |||
| fix a bug: in deltas, in the for loop, build-random-population in each i | x || see if it solves the flat simulations |
| merge module c & d, from now on, run raco test for each module test | x |||
| list the decision tree of an auto | x |||
| return the states + the payoff in each round | 14 jan || so we can see active states of two automaton in a match (in equilibrium)|
| walk through the workflow |x || pay attention to function vector-set!|
| write some func to investigate automaton |v || hmm, |
| change to no-gui to run on clusters@.. | x |||
| try ssh key | x |||
| back up the job description (which'd be sent to cluster) | || next time just edit that file|
| only export data every 10 cycle (reduce data size) |x |||
| issue: high states -> lower periods -> maybe due to inefficient learning (not quite equilibrium). so if reduce states -> has to increase cycles. | || run the same combination of (cycle,states) w pd to see|
| run across deltas, pies, states# | 17 jan | | |
