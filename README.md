how to run

```
racket -tm main.rkt
```
```
raco test -s five main.rkt 
```

how to run in lab 1 computer:

- change the directory for the output into a dropbox folder
(ie smt like: "/Users/linhchi.nguyen/Dropbox/fsm-bar/run1/mean.png")

```
(require (file "/Users/linhchi.nguyen/Documents/fsm-bar/main.rkt"))
