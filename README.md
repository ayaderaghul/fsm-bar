## how to run in mathematica

there are two main files: `basic.rkt` which is used for the grand simulation.
`side.rkt` is for the side project (or spinoff).

before running, it's necessary to change the directory for the output.

- open `side.rkt`, the CONFIGURATION is at the beginning:

- change the directory to smt like: "/Users/linhchi.nguyen/Dropbox/fsm-bar/run1/mean.png"

- then change the variables accordingly, for example: N 100, CYCLES 100000...

- then run the file `run-in-matha.nb` in mathematica

### how to run in lab 1 computer:

- change the directory for the output into a dropbox folder
(ie smt like: "/Users/linhchi.nguyen/Dropbox/fsm-bar/run1/mean.png")

```
(require (file "/Users/linhchi.nguyen/Documents/fsm-bar/main.rkt"))

```

### how to run in disa lab computer:
- change directory for output:
"C:/Documents and Settings/linhchi.nguyen/My Documents/Dropbox/fsm-bar/run6/mean"

```
(require (file "R:/fsm-bar/main.rkt"))
```

#### extra

in general, the command to run is

```
racket -tm side.rkt
```

with -tm and no further specification, racket will evaluate the function `main inside the file (module) side.rkt

```
raco test -s five main.rkt 
```
